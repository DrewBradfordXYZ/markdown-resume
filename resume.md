### Document Generation Tool for SOWs, PDDs and Proposals
Developed a Word Document generator that stores files in QuickBase for seamless storage. Document templates and variables within Quickbaseare easily accessible. Template HTML is converted to DOCX files. The document dynamically adjusts based on various criteria such as Deal Type, GEO, Sales District, Billing Type, Customer Type and Risk Category.

### Task Based Service Calculator
Developed an intuitive cart based calculator UI in Vue.js for scoping services. Users can allocate quantities to predefined tasks, add co-provider information and add custom LOE to specific Roles. SMEs have access to a QuickBase app that controls the entire display and behavior of the Vue.js app. The calculator features a seamless document-variable system that hydrates the "Document Generation Tool" mentioned above. Redacted screen-shots of the front-end are available on request.

### Bundled Services Calculator
Developed a streamlined, single-button service creation tool with simplified form inputs that auto-calculates and creates a complete bid. A series of "cost-factor" and "site-tier" table lookups calculate LOE for Roles in each Service associated with a selected Component Type.
